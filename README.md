# Image-Caption-Generator

Welcome to the Image-Caption-Generator project! This project aims to generate descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence generation, the model can produce coherent and relevant captions for a wide variety of images.

## Introduction

The Image-Caption-Generator project combines the power of CNNs and RNNs to create a model capable of generating human-like captions for images. This project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NLTK.

## Applications

- **Social Media:** Automatically generate captions for photos uploaded by users.
- **Accessibility:** Provide descriptions of images to visually impaired users.
- **E-commerce:** Generate product descriptions from images to enhance searchability.
- **Content Creation:** Assist in generating descriptions and tags for content creators.
- **Photography:** Help photographers by providing automatic descriptions for their portfolios.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `Image_caption_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the complete project code, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: The readme file you are currently reading.
- `image_caption_project.py`: Python script with the core implementation of the image captioning model.
- `model_18.h5`: Pre-trained model weights.
- `tokenizer.pkl`: Tokenizer object used for text processing.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You will also need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras nltk numpy pillow
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

-> Open and run the Image_caption_Project.ipynb notebook to see the step-by-step implementation and results.

Run the Python Script:

-> To generate captions using the pre-trained model, run the following command:

```bash
python image_caption_project.py --image_path /path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Results

Below are some sample results generated by the model:
```code
Caption: "A group of people standing around a table with food."
Caption: "A dog sitting on a couch in a living room."
```
